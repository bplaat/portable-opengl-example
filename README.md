# Simple WebAssembly WebGL / Native OpenGL Example
A simple WebAssembly WebGL / native desktop OpenGL 3.3 Core window example

You need the [LLVM toolchain](https://llvm.org/) to run the `build.sh` script, you also need the [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/) library to build the native desktop application. It is very usefull to use the [WebAssembly Binary Toolkit](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) tools to disassamble and inspect your wasm bundles.
